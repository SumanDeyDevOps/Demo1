## Reporting a Vulnerability
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

As it's a public repository, updates are often made. 
Once an issue or vulnerability has been raised/reported, i will look into it and start working on it.

More information is always available in the Readme file.

(Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.)
